# Prerequisites

In this section we work to configure our local machine so we can build and run all lab examples.

## Overview
The main lab prerequisite is having [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and running. 
We are also using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) and [Spring Boot](https://gradle.org/)

All the lab examples are built to work with:
* OS-X
* Ubuntu

If you DO NOT have one of those OSs installed we will use the following section to configure an Ubuntu virtual machine and use it for the lab.

## Install Virtual Box or VMWare Fusion Player

### Option 1: Virtual Box
* Download Virtual Box: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
* Download Ubuntu Virtual Box image: https://www.osboxes.org/ubuntu/#ubuntu-21-04-vbox
* Create a new virtual machine using the downloaded image: https://www.leawo.org/entips/vdi-file-what-is-it-how-to-open-it-1400.html#part2


### Option 2: VMWare Fusion Player

* Create a VMWare personal Account: https://customerconnect.vmware.com/web/vmware/evalcenter?p=fusion-player-personal
* Register free Fusion Player license
* Download and install Fusion Player 
* Download Fusion virtual disk image: https://www.osboxes.org/ubuntu/#ubuntu-21-04-vmware
* Create a new virtual machine using the downloaded image: https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1023555
* Install VMWare Tools: `sudo apt-get install open-vm-tools open-vm-tools-desktop`. And reboot the VM


## Configure your Ubuntu VM
Note: Default username is `osboxes.org` and password is `osboxes.org`

Install required software:
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux)
* Docker: 
    * Install: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
    * Add your user in docker users group: 
      ```
        sudo groupadd docker
        sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
        newgrp docker
      ```
    * Add at the end of your ~/.bashrc file the following lines line so you can build from any shell: 
    ```# Switch groups, but only if necessary
    if [[ `id -gn` != "docker" ]]
    then
      newgrp docker
      exit
    fi
    ```

Install Docker Compose:
* https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

Install IntelliJ Community Edition: 
* Download and extract: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installation-guide.html#standalone 
* Add in your ~/.bashrc file an alias to help you open IntelliJ easier:
  * IntelliJ would be located on a path similar to `/home/osboxes/Downloads/ideaIC-2021.2.3/idea-IC-212.5457.46/bin/idea.sh`
  * Adding an alias is done by adding in your ~/.bashrc file the path like this: ```alias IntelliJ=/home/osboxes/Downloads/ideaIC-2021.2.3/idea-IC-212.5457.46/bin/idea.sh```
* Source the new profile: `source ~/.profile`

Install OpenJDK 11:  
* `sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk`

Install Make: 
* `sudo apt install make`
